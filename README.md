# Build a product landing page

Free Code Camp challenge #3.

Cofee, coffee, coffee. That's all I could think of, at this point, so I decided to go forth and build a landing page themed about the coffee lovers websites (tributes and survey form) previously built. Again, colour palettes and typography were retained, from the previous projects.
